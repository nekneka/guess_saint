# Guess Saint
## What & Why
Quiz for android which suggests a painting for user to guess which saint was depicted on it.

It is possible to do when you know which attributes correspond to particular saint: to make them recognizable, painters depicted famous attributes in their paintings. E.g. keys for Saint Peter, or skin for Saint Bartholomeo.

The idea of being able to guess the saint given painted attributes seemed fun, so I implemented it.
